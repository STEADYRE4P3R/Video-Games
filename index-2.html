If it is a weekday you should not play video games. For kids they can only play on weekends and their summer break. If someone you know will not get off video games for multiple days you should talk to a doctor if addiction antibiotics are needed.</p></div>

Once you do that you turn the console. Next, click on the game icon that it shows once you enter the home page of the console. Once you do that you can enjoy your video game.  In more new technology you can download games from the console instead of using a disc. If you download the game you just have to click the icon for the video game. Enjoy your video game!</p></div>
